NewYork Times Movie Review (JSP,Servlet,MVC,Java7)Full Stack Project:

About:

The goal of the project is to create an application integrated with New York Times movie review API. 

The requirements are:
•	There should be at least a minimal styled Web frontend
•	List an arbitrary number of movie reviews 
•	It should be possible to search for a specific movie 
•	It should be possible to see a short review summary for a specific movie 
•	If New York Times adds a new review it would be nice if the list automatically could reflect the change. 

Main technologies used during development:
